1. Title

Using ChatGPT to quantify land use/land cover changes between two qualitative rasters

2. Research question(s)

Can ChatGPT solve complicated coding problems? Can we develop code that is reproducible and modular?

3. Objective(s)

i. Attempt to develop R code that can compare differences between two qualitative rasters.

ii. Document and understand how ChatGPT can understand and solve methodological problems.

iii. Determine if ChatGPT can solve a specific problem, similar to a software engineer.

4. Approach

I will ask ChatGPT to create two synthetic land use/land cover rasters representing the same region at different points in time, and then I will ask ChatGPT to quantify the differences between the two rasters, all in R (R Core Team 2024). Each ChatGPT response will be saved to individual text files, and each code response will be saved to individual .R files. I will iterate through this process until I have determined whether ChatGPT can effectively solve the problem. I will measure ChatGPTâ€™s success against an already existing tool in ArcGIS Pro that can perform this operation (ESRI). I will document any revisions I make to ChatGPT-generated code.
